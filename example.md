# Prologue

Mistvale is an isolated, fog-shrouded village haunted by tragedy, superstition, and secrets best left undisturbed. The campaign begins as the characters arrive, drawn by rumors of disappearances, hidden riches, or simply the need for shelter. The GM should set an oppressive, uncanny atmosphere: the fog is not natural, and the villagers seem as afraid of strangers as they are of whatever lurks in the darkness.

> **GM Note:**
> The introduction should be unsettling and evocative. Emphasize the villagers' discomfort and reluctance to talk. Treat the fog as a character: omnipresent and hostile.

![](images/example-image-4.png)

Mistvale is surrounded by dense woods and steep hills. The only road in is muddy and poorly maintained. The village itself consists of a handful of stone and timber buildings clustered around a central square, with a ruined abbey looming on a nearby hilltop. The fog is ever-present, muting sound and color, and making navigation difficult even for locals.

- The main themes are isolation, suspicion, and the thin barrier between the mundane and the supernatural.
- The campaign is designed for 3–5 characters of any background, though those with ties to the supernatural or the church may find themselves especially entangled.
- The story unfolds in seven chapters, each offering opportunities for investigation, combat, social intrigue, and moral choices.

**Opening Narration**

*Fog shrouds the road, wrapping the trees and silence in a damp shroud. Hooves thud dully on wet earth. In the distance, a bell tolls, faint, signaling the end of the day. Mistvale appears before you like a shadow in the mist, its dark wooden houses and steep roofs huddled beneath the gray sky. A crow watches from a fence post, and as you cross the village threshold, the air itself seems to weigh on your shoulders. The inn, "The Smoking Lantern," offers the only warm light in the settlement. As you enter, the murmur dies and all eyes fix on you. The adventure begins, and the fog seems to close the exit behind you.*
:::

# Chapter 1: Arrival in Mistvale

This chapter sets the tone and setting. The characters can explore the village, meet key NPCs, and begin to sense that nothing is as it seems. The GM should pace the information and let the players take the lead in investigation.

Mistvale is not a welcoming place. The villagers are wary of newcomers, and most keep their distance. The only exceptions are those with urgent needs or secrets to hide. The fog seems to follow the characters, thickening as they approach certain locations. The local children are especially superstitious, and many carry charms or talismans for protection.

## 1.1 The Fog Road

The journey to Mistvale should feel long and perilous. The fog makes navigation difficult and may cause the characters to doubt their senses. The crow that follows them may be an omen or a guide, as the GM chooses. If the players ignore it, simply add tension; if they follow, reward their curiosity with a minor clue.

- **Sights:** Trees looming out of the mist, distant church bells, flickers of movement in the fog.
- **Sounds:** Distant howls, the caw of the crow, the muffled thud of hooves or boots.
- **Feelings:** A sense of being watched, chills, confusion over direction.

The road is muddy and uneven, with deep ruts from carts that have long since broken down. Occasional stone markers, covered in moss and lichen, hint at the road's ancient origins. The fog grows thicker as the party nears the village, obscuring even the shapes of their own companions.

###### Random Encounters on the Road

Traveling the road to Mistvale is never uneventful, especially as the fog grows denser. Here are some possible encounters to use, each of which can set the tone for the supernatural and unsettling nature of the region:

- **A lost child, mute and shivering, who vanishes if followed.** The child leaves behind a small wooden toy, carved with strange runes.
- **A tangle of thorny vines that seem to move when not watched.** If touched, the thorns draw blood and the fog briefly becomes thicker.
- **A strange, old signpost pointing in impossible directions.** The names on the sign are in a language no one recognizes.
- **The sound of distant, echoing laughter that fades when approached.** The laughter sometimes turns into sobbing as the party draws near.
- **A broken cart with strange runes carved into the wood.** Searching the cart reveals a journal with cryptic warnings about the fog.

> **GM Note:**
> If the characters split up or get lost in the fog, use the fog effects table later on. Don't be afraid to unsettle the players with inexplicable events, but avoid unfair punishment at this early stage.

## 1.2 The Inn Encounter

The "Smoking Lantern" inn is the social heart of Mistvale. Here, the characters can interact with villagers, gather rumors, and begin to suspect that something is very wrong. The main NPCs have their own secrets and motivations, and may become allies or complications depending on player actions.

The inn is dimly lit, with a large hearth fire and a handful of battered tables. The air is thick with the smell of smoke, damp wool, and stew. Most villagers keep to themselves, speaking in low voices and glancing nervously at the newcomers. The innkeeper, Mirta, does her best to maintain a cheerful facade, but her eyes betray her worry.

::: rules
title: Rest Action

The inn offers a place to rest and recover. Characters can spend time here to regain Will or heal minor wounds. However, the atmosphere is oppressive, and sleep may be troubled by nightmares or strange dreams related to the fog.
:::

The atmosphere is tense and conversations are brief and evasive. Villagers avoid speaking of the abbey or the disappearances, but a child approaches and hands the characters a cold iron amulet, saying he found it near the dry well. This object will be important later.

**Rumors available at the inn:**

- "The fog has never lifted since the fire at the abbey."
- "People vanish on the new moon. Some say the woods take them."
- "The priest is not what he seems."
- "If you hear singing in the fog, run."
- "The old well is cursed. Don't go near it after dark."

::: squarebox
**Inn Scene**

*The door creaks shut behind you. The warmth of the fire contrasts with the chill outside, but tension fills the air. Mirta greets you with a forced smile, while Jacob, seated in the corner, watches you openly. Father Silvan mutters a prayer, eyes lost in the candle flame. The murmur resumes, but conversations are barely whispers. A child approaches and offers you a cold iron amulet, saying he found it near the dry well. Night falls over Mistvale, and the fog thickens behind the steamed windows.*

## 1.3 Key NPCs at the Inn

The following NPCs are central to the story and can provide clues, aid, or complications. Each has a distinct personality and secret that can be revealed through investigation or social interaction.

::: table
title: NPCs

| NPC Name           | Description            | Motivation       | Secret                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Mirta              | Robust, kind innkeeper | Protect her son  | Her son is missing        |
| Jacob the One-Eyed | Hard-eyed outsider     | Seeks his sister | He suspects the priest    |
| Father Silvan      | Trembling priest       | Hides a secret   | He knows about the cult   |
| Marta the Maid     | Nervous, eavesdropper  | Wants to escape  | She saw the cult's ritual |

:::

\fullpageend

> **GM Note:**
> Let the players ask questions and seek alliances. NPCs can give hints, but never the whole truth. If the characters are hostile or too nosy, they may earn the villagers' distrust.

The characters can interact with these NPCs to gather information, form alliances, or create enemies. Each NPC has a unique perspective on the fog and the village's troubles, and their secrets can lead to further adventures or complications.

::: squarebox
**NPC Interaction Example**

*Mirta wipes her hands on her apron and approaches you. "You look like you could use a warm meal. The stew is fresh, and I have some bread left." She glances around nervously before lowering her voice. "But be careful. The fog... it changes people. My son went out to gather herbs last week and hasn't returned. I fear the worst." Her eyes well up with tears, but she quickly composes herself. "If you find him, please bring him back."*
:::

# Chapter 2: Secrets Beneath the Fog

This chapter focuses on investigation and exploration. The characters can visit different village locations, question villagers, and discover clues about the fog and the disappearances. Alternate tense moments with meaningful discoveries to keep the pace.

The village is divided into several key locations, each with its own secrets and dangers. The characters are free to choose where to go and whom to trust. Some villagers may offer help, while others will do anything to protect their own secrets.

## 2.1 Rumors and Clues

Rumors circulate, but it's hard to tell truth from superstition. Villagers speak of disappearances during the new moon, the burned abbey, and strange chants in the woods. Some believe the fog is a curse, others a divine punishment.

- **Disappearances:** Each new moon, someone vanishes without trace. None dare go out at night.
- **The Abbey:** After the fire, the abbey was left in ruins. None approach it now; it is said to be cursed.
- **The Woods:** At night, some have heard chanting or seen lights among the trees.
- **The Well:** Some say you can hear voices from its depths.
- **The Bell Tower:** The bell sometimes tolls by itself at midnight.

Let players choose which lead to follow first, encouraging free exploration.

![](images/example-image-3.jpg)

###### Methods of Investigation

The characters have several ways to uncover the truth behind the fog and the disappearances. Each method can lead to different clues or encounters, and creative use of these approaches should be rewarded:

- **Questioning villagers:** Using charm, intimidation, or bribery can persuade villagers to share what they know. Some may reveal hidden fears, while others might attempt to mislead or warn the party away.
- **Exploring suspicious locations:** The well, the woods, and the abbey each hold secrets. Searching these places may reveal evidence of cult activity, supernatural phenomena, or lost villagers.
- **Following the crow or other omens:** The crow often appears before significant events. Tracking it might lead to hidden sites or warnings of danger.
- **Examining the amulet for magical properties:** Arcane knowledge or rituals can reveal the amulet's protective power against the fog and its denizens.
- **Watching the inn at night for suspicious activity:** Some cultists may meet after dark, or villagers may sneak out to perform strange rites.

Villagers are generally reluctant to speak, but may be convinced with kindness, gifts, or displays of strength. Some are genuinely frightened, while others are complicit in the cult's activities.

> **GM Note:**
> Each rumor should lead to a relevant location or NPC. If players show the amulet, some villagers react with fear, others with superstition. Use this to build tension and hint at its importance.

## 2.2 The First Sinister Encounter

The dry well is a key investigation point. Approaching it, the fog thickens and the temperature drops. Here, the first supernatural encounter occurs: a shadow emerges from the mist and attacks, proving the threat is real.

The well is surrounded by old, crumbling stones and overgrown weeds. The air is unnaturally cold, and the sound of dripping water echoes from the depths. Scratches and strange symbols are carved into the stones around the rim.

::: squarebox
**Well Encounter**

*As you investigate the dry well, the fog thickens and the cold intensifies. A shadow slides over the rim, barely visible except for two red eyes glowing in the gloom. A chill runs down your spines as the figure materializes, extending long, sharp claws. Silence reigns, broken only by your racing hearts. The shadow lunges, and the fog swirls around it like a cloak.*

# Chapter 3: The Cursed Abbey

The abbey is the heart of the mystery. Here the curse began, and here lies the key to breaking it. Exploring the abbey is dangerous, filled with traps, spectral presences, and forgotten secrets.

The abbey stands atop a low hill, its stone walls blackened by fire. The roof has collapsed in places, and the stained glass windows are shattered. Vines and moss creep over the stones, and the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decay.

::: environment

impulses: Isolate wanderers, reveal illusions, protect ancient secrets
difficulty: 13
adversaries: mist drake, fen specter
features:
  - Illusive Light: The mist bends light, creating phantom bridges and false clearings.
  - Mistbound: Creatures native to the fen can vanish and reappear at will within the fog.
:::

## 3.1 Exploring the Ruins

The abbey is divided into several zones: the crypt, the sacristy, the bell tower, and a hidden cellar. Each offers different challenges and rewards. Describe the decay, strange symbols on the walls, and the constant feeling of being watched.

::: table

| Location      | Risk      | Reward             |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Crypt         | Ghosts    | Sacred relic       |
| Sacristy      | Trap      | Ancient scroll     |
| Bell Tower    | Vision    | View of the valley |
| Hidden Cellar | Adversary | Protective amulet  |

:::

- **The crypt** is cold and silent, with ancient bones and flickering ghostly lights.
- **The sacristy** contains broken furniture and a hidden trapdoor.
- **The bell tower** provides a vantage point but is dangerous to climb.
- **The hidden cellar** is accessible only by solving a puzzle or finding a secret lever.

The abbey's walls are covered in faded murals depicting saints and monsters. Some of the symbols have been defaced or overwritten with strange runes. In the crypt, the air is so cold that breath steams even in summer.

::: squarebox
**Abbey Exploration**

*The ruins of the abbey rise like a stone skeleton in the mist. The altar is covered in strange symbols, and the air grows heavier with each step. Fresh footprints in the dust suggest you are not alone. A distant echo reverberates beneath the floor, and every corner seems to hide ancient secrets. The silence is so thick that any sound seems a shout. Touching the altar, you feel a strange vibration, as if something stirs beneath your feet.*
:::

> **GM Note:**
> If the characters explore thoroughly, they may find an old diary, a hidden passage, or even accidentally release a minor spirit.

###### Hazards in the Abbey

Exploring the abbey is fraught with danger. These hazards can be used to challenge the party or add suspense to their investigations:

- **Collapsing floors and ceilings:** Parts of the abbey are unstable, and a wrong step can lead to a sudden fall or being trapped beneath rubble.
- **Sudden drops in temperature:** Supernatural chills can sap the characters' strength and resolve, causing exhaustion or fear.
- **Apparitions that drain Will or cause fear:** Ghostly figures may appear, whispering secrets or threats, and can weaken the party's mental fortitude.
- **Traps left by the cult to deter intruders:** Hidden snares, poisoned needles, or magical wards may be found in key locations.
- **Cursed objects that tempt the greedy:** Relics left behind may offer power, but at a terrible price if taken.

:::

> **GM Note:**
> Use these events to delay progress, provide clues, or increase the danger of exploration.

# Chapter 4: The Fog Cult

As the investigation deepens, the party’s suspicions crystallize into a chilling certainty: a secretive cult operates at the heart of Mistvale’s misfortunes. The cult’s presence is a shadowy thread running through every tragedy, every unexplained disappearance, and every whispered warning. The villagers’ furtive glances and the strange patterns in the fog all point to a clandestine group that worships the Voice Beneath the Fog—a force they believe will grant them power, protection, or absolution.

The cult is not a monolith; it is a patchwork of desperate villagers, zealous outsiders, and those seduced by the promise of forbidden knowledge. Some members are true believers, convinced that the fog is a blessing and the Voice a misunderstood guardian. Others are drawn by fear, blackmail, or the hope of saving a loved one. The cult’s leader, known only as the Master of the Fog, is a figure of both awe and terror—his charisma binds the group, but his instability threatens to unravel it all.

![](images/example-image-2.png)

Cultists are rarely seen in daylight. At night, however, they move with purpose, slipping through the mist in hooded robes and eerie masks. Their rituals are a blend of ancient superstition and dark innovation: chanting in forgotten tongues, drawing sigils with ash and blood, and wielding cold iron as both a ward and a weapon. The fog itself seems to obey their will, thickening to hide their movements or swallowing up the screams of their victims.

The cult’s hierarchy is loose but effective. The Master commands absolute loyalty, his word law within the circle. Beneath him are trusted lieutenants—each with their own secrets and ambitions. The rank and file are a mixture of the devout and the desperate, each marked by a distinctive trait or ritual scar.

::: table
title: Random Cultist

| Cultist       | Distinctive Trait | Weapon        |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Hooded Leader | Hypnotic voice    | Ritual dagger |
| Young Acolyte | Tattoos           | Wooden staff  |
| Blind Crone   | Smells of incense | Sharp nails   |
| Mute Twins    | Blank stare       | Ropes         |

:::

The cult’s influence permeates Mistvale. Some villagers aid them out of fear; others turn a blind eye, hoping to avoid notice. The fog is both their shield and their prison, for while it grants them power, it also isolates them from the world beyond.

## 4.1 Discovery

Uncovering the cult’s activities is a pivotal moment in the campaign. The party might stumble upon a ritual by following strange lights into the woods, overhearing coded conversations in the inn, or tracking a missing villager to a secluded glade. However they arrive, the scene is always the same: a circle of masked figures, the air thick with incense and fear, and a victim—bound, gagged, and awaiting a grim fate.

The ritual site is a study in contrasts: the natural beauty of the forest marred by scorched earth, twisted symbols, and the acrid stench of burning herbs. The chanting is guttural, rhythmic, and utterly alien—words that seem to claw at the edges of understanding. The fog is so dense that even torchlight struggles to penetrate it, and every shadow seems to move with a will of its own.

::: rules
title: Safe Haven

When characters find shelter in a well-guarded or consecrated location, such as the inn or a protected home, they may attempt to rest and recover. During a short rest, each character can regain a small amount of Will or heal minor wounds. However, if the party chooses to spend the night, the GM may introduce unsettling dreams, cryptic visions, or lingering unease as a reminder that true safety is rare in Mistvale. Only in places truly protected from the supernatural can the party rest without risk of nightmares or mysterious disturbances.
:::

If the party intervenes, chaos erupts. Cultists scatter into the mist, some fighting with wild abandon, others fleeing with inhuman speed. The victim’s fate hangs in the balance—saving them may earn the party a grateful ally, but it also paints a target on their backs.

- **The cult uses the fog as both weapon and escape route:** Pursuing them is perilous, as the mists twist paths and conceal traps.
- **Rituals are always guarded:** Even a lone cultist may have a hidden bell or whistle to summon reinforcements.
- **The victim may hold crucial information:** Perhaps they overheard plans, glimpsed the cult’s true leader, or possess a token the cult desperately wants returned.
- **Evidence abounds:** Scraps of parchment, ritual implements, and the lingering aura of dark magic can all be found by those who search carefully.

> **GM Note:**
> Build tension with sound and sensation: the snap of a twig, the sudden hush as chanting stops, the cold brush of fog against skin. Let the players feel the cult’s paranoia and fanaticism—these are people who believe they are on the brink of something world-changing, and will fight or flee with equal fervor.

### Cultist Tactics

Cultists are more than mere thugs; they are cunning, desperate, and intimately familiar with the terrain. Their tactics are shaped by the fog and their knowledge of the woods:

- **Obscured Movement:** Cultists dart in and out of the mist, using it to break line of sight and launch ambushes.
- **Ritual Completion at All Costs:** Even when threatened, their priority is the ritual. Some may sacrifice themselves to buy time.
- **Summoning Aid:** A few cultists can call upon minor spirits or animate shadows to harass the party.
- **Divide and Conquer:** They target isolated or distracted characters, seeking to overwhelm one foe at a time.
- **Negotiation and Deceit:** When cornered, a cultist might plead for mercy, offer information (true or false), or try to sow discord among the party.

> **GM Note:**
> Let cultists use the environment—roots, low branches, sudden drops in the terrain—to their advantage. If the party is too cautious, the cult may slip away entirely, leaving only cryptic warnings and a growing sense of dread.

## 4.2 Adversary: Cult Leader

::: adversary
name: Master of the Fog
type: Tier 2 Solo
description: A fanatical sorcerer, swathed in bandages and mist. His eyes burn with unnatural light, and his voice carries the weight of prophecy and madness.
tactics: Control the fog, attack from afar, manipulate cultists and spirits
difficulty: 14
thresholds: 12 / 24
hp: 10
stress: 5
atk: +3
weapons:
  - Fog Ray: Ranged | 2d6 (Magical)
features:
  - Protective Mist: Ranged attacks against him have disadvantage.
  - Summon Specters: Can summon 1d4 Mist Shadows.
  - Voice of Command: Once per encounter, can force a cultist or weak-willed NPC to act immediately.
:::

The Master of the Fog is both the cult’s heart and its greatest liability. He is charismatic, but his grip on reality is tenuous. In battle, he uses the fog to obscure himself, striking from a distance and summoning spirits to do his bidding. If pressed, he will not hesitate to sacrifice his followers or himself to complete the ritual.

If defeated, the cult’s structure collapses. Some members flee into the night, others surrender, and a few may beg the party for protection or forgiveness. But the Master’s defeat does not end the threat—the fog’s source remains, and the true confrontation still lies ahead.

> **GM Note:**
> Make the Master’s presence unsettling. His words should hint at knowledge beyond mortal ken, and his powers should warp the very air around him. The fight should feel desperate and strange, with the fog itself seeming to resist the party’s every move. If the players save the victim, reward them not just with gratitude, but with a vital clue or an unexpected ally.

# Chapter 5: Revelations

The air in Mistvale grows heavier as night falls, a sense of anticipation settling over the village. The clues the characters have gathered—cryptic warnings, missing villagers, the oppressive presence of the fog—begin to form a pattern. Whispers in the dark, half-remembered rituals, and the haunted eyes of Father Silvan all point to a single, chilling truth: the curse that suffocates Mistvale is not a random misfortune, but the result of a desperate, unfinished act from the village’s past.

This chapter is the turning point of the campaign. Here, the party pieces together the fragmented history of the abbey, the cult, and the supernatural force known as the Voice Beneath the Fog. The sense of mystery gives way to the realization that the fate of Mistvale—and perhaps their own souls—depends on the choices they make in the coming hours.

The discovery of the diary is a moment of revelation and dread. Its pages, fragile and stained, hold the confessions and regrets of those who tried to contain the darkness, and failed. As the party reads, the boundaries between past and present blur; the echoes of old prayers and desperate bargains seem to fill the silence around them.

![](images/example-image-1.png)

## 5.1 The Lost Diary

The diary is a battered, leather-bound volume, its cover warped by heat and water. Inside, the ink runs in places, but enough remains legible to piece together a harrowing account. The entries begin with hope: descriptions of the abbey’s construction, the arrival of the first relics, and the pride of a community united in faith. But as the pages turn, the tone shifts—first to anxiety as the fog creeps in, then to horror as disappearances begin and prayers go unanswered.

The writer describes the growing influence of a secretive cult, their rituals held in the dead of night, and the gradual corruption of the abbey’s leaders. There are mentions of strange lights in the woods, voices heard beneath the floor, and the sense that the fog itself is alive, hungry for something only the villagers can provide.

The final entries are almost illegible, written in a trembling hand. They speak of a failed ritual, a fire set to hide the evidence, and the burden of guilt that cannot be washed away. The last page is a plea to anyone who finds the diary: to finish what was started, to succeed where the writer failed, and to beware the Voice that waits in the mist.

::: squarebox
**Diary Reading**

*"Today we sealed the crypt. But the fog does not lift. Something watches us from the other side... Father Silvan says we must pray, but I know only the sacrifice of an innocent can maintain the seal. I hid the amulet in the bell tower, hoping none would find it. If you read this, beware: the Voice Beneath the Fog does not forget, and the fog is its breath."*
:::

The revelations within the diary are both a guide and a warning. The cold iron amulet, mentioned repeatedly, is described as a ward against the shadows that serve the Voice. The writer’s fear is palpable—every page seems to tremble with the weight of secrets too terrible to bear.

As the party digests these revelations, the atmosphere in Mistvale shifts. The fog presses closer to the windows, and the distant sound of chanting can sometimes be heard on the wind. The villagers seem more withdrawn, their eyes haunted by memories they refuse to share. The sense of urgency grows: the next new moon is approaching, and with it, the final chance to break the curse or be consumed by it.

- The cold iron amulet is a key defense, its presence unsettling to the cultists and their supernatural allies.
- The cult’s ultimate goal is revealed: to unleash the Voice Beneath the Fog, believing it will grant them power or absolution.
- The purification of the altar is not a simple act, but a dangerous ritual that demands sacrifice and courage.
- The hidden passage under the bell tower offers a secret route to the crypt, but is likely trapped or guarded by restless spirits.

###### Clues from the Diary

The diary’s scattered notes and desperate warnings offer the following insights:

- **The original ritual was incomplete:** The seal on the crypt is weak, and the Voice is growing stronger with each passing night. The ritual must be finished, or the fog will spread beyond Mistvale.
- **The abbey fire was not an accident:** The cult set the blaze to erase evidence of their failure, sacrificing innocents in the process. The spirits of the dead may linger, seeking justice or revenge.
- **Father Silvan’s guilt:** The priest’s evasiveness and fear are signs of his involvement. He may hold the final piece of the puzzle, or be a pawn of darker forces.
- **The amulet’s power peaks at midnight:** Timing the final confrontation is crucial. The party must decide whether to trust the diary’s instructions, risk improvisation, or seek another way.

> **GM Note:**
> Let the diary serve as both a roadmap and a source of dread. Read passages aloud, letting the players feel the weight of history pressing down on them. Encourage them to connect the dots between the diary, the villagers’ stories, and the physical clues they’ve uncovered. This is the moment when the campaign’s mysteries crystallize into a clear, terrifying challenge.

The discovery of the diary should prompt discussion and debate among the players. Do they trust its account? Will they risk the dangers of the crypt, or try to find another way to break the curse? The choices they make now will shape the climax of the story.

## 5.2 Random Night Encounters Table

As the party prepares for the final confrontation, the nights in Mistvale grow increasingly perilous. The fog thickens, strange sounds echo through the village, and the boundary between the living and the dead becomes ever more fragile. Use the following table to heighten tension and keep the players on edge during their rest or nighttime investigations.

::: table

| d6  | Night Encounter in Mistvale                            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | A villager knocks, begging for help.                   |
| 2   | Strange noises on the roof.                            |
| 3   | A specter passes through the wall, whispering secrets. |

| 5   | A shadow tries to steal a magical item.                |
| 6   | A character dreams of the Voice Beneath the Fog.       |

:::

> **GM Note:**
> Use these encounters to reinforce the sense that nowhere in Mistvale is truly safe. Even rest brings no comfort, and every night is a reminder that the fog is watching, waiting for the party to falter. Let these events foreshadow the dangers ahead and keep the players invested in the unfolding mystery.

# Chapter 6: The Final Ritual

The moment of truth has arrived. All the clues, sacrifices, and desperate gambits have led the party to the crypt beneath the ruined abbey—a place where the air itself seems to pulse with ancient dread. The descent is a journey into the heart of Mistvale’s darkness: stone steps slick with condensation, walls etched with forgotten prayers, and the oppressive weight of centuries pressing down from above. Every sound is amplified, every shadow seems to move, and the sense of being watched is inescapable.

The crypt is more than a tomb; it is the stage for the village’s last hope and greatest terror. The altar at its center is a grotesque monument, stained with the evidence of past rituals and ringed by flickering runes that pulse in time with the party’s heartbeats. The fog here is thicker, almost tangible, coiling around ankles and whispering in voices half-remembered from childhood nightmares.

This is not just a battle of swords and spells, but of wills and souls. The party must decide not only how to confront the Voice Beneath the Fog, but what they are willing to sacrifice for Mistvale’s salvation. The choices made here—whether to purify the altar, destroy it, use the amulet, or attempt some other desperate stratagem—will shape the fate of every soul in the village.

## 6.1 Preparations

The hours or moments before the ritual are fraught with tension. Every character feels the weight of expectation and fear. Some may seek out surviving villagers for last-minute aid: a blessing from the priest, a healing poultice from the herbalist, or simply a word of encouragement from a child whose hope has not yet been extinguished. Others may turn inward, steeling themselves for the ordeal to come or wrestling with doubts about what is truly right.

Setting magical wards or traps becomes a frantic, whispered affair—chalk symbols scrawled on flagstones, candles lit with trembling hands, and salt poured in careful circles. The crypt’s oppressive atmosphere makes every action feel urgent, every sound a potential omen. Researching the original ritual might yield a crucial insight or a forgotten ingredient, while creating distractions above could buy precious seconds when the cult inevitably tries to intervene.

Perhaps most difficult is the decision of who will wield the amulet or make the ultimate sacrifice. The amulet’s cold weight is a reminder that power always comes with a price, and the knowledge that the ritual may demand more than anyone is willing to give hangs heavy in the air.

**Crypt Climax**

*The crypt opens before you like a wound in the earth. The walls ooze dampness and the air is unbreathable. In the center, the altar glows with unnatural light, and the fog coils in impossible spirals. Voices whisper in your ears, promising power, vengeance, or redemption. The Voice Beneath the Fog materializes, a shapeless shadow with countless eyes and mouths that never stop murmuring. The final battle is about to begin, and only one side will prevail.*

## 6.2 Final Adversary

The confrontation with the Voice Beneath the Fog is more than a test of strength; it is a struggle of hope against despair, light against the encroaching dark. The entity’s presence warps reality: torches flicker with unnatural colors, the ground trembles with each syllable of its whispered threats, and the air is filled with the scent of decay and old secrets.

As the battle rages, the Voice may try to tempt the characters with visions of lost loved ones, promises of power, or threats against the innocent. The fog thickens, sometimes obscuring friend from foe, and the runes on the altar flare with every blow struck. The entity’s attacks are not just physical or magical, but psychological—each failed defense saps the party’s will, each injury threatens to unravel their resolve.

Victory is possible, but it will not come without cost. The altar may shatter, releasing a final pulse of energy; the amulet may crack, its power spent; and the crypt itself may begin to collapse as the ancient magic sustaining it unravels.

If the party fails, the Voice may escape, its influence spreading beyond Mistvale. If they succeed, the fog will thin, but the scars—both physical and emotional—will linger.

> **GM Note:**
> Make this battle feel truly climactic. Use sensory details, shifting terrain, and the Voice’s ability to manipulate minds and emotions. Allow for moments of heroism, sacrifice, and even despair. The outcome should feel earned, and the consequences—good or bad—should resonate through the remainder of the story.

# Chapter 7: The Echo of the Fog

In the aftermath of the final confrontation, Mistvale is transformed. The fog may lift, revealing a village battered but free at last, or it may linger, a reminder that some evils cannot be wholly banished. The villagers emerge from their homes, faces etched with awe and uncertainty, and the silence is broken by tentative laughter, quiet weeping, or the song of a bird not heard in years.

The party’s actions ripple outward: those who survived the ordeal are changed, marked by what they have seen and done. Some may be hailed as heroes, others regarded with suspicion or fear, especially if the cost of victory was high. Old wounds may begin to heal, or new divisions may form as the truth of the cult and the curse comes to light.

This chapter is a time for reflection, for tying up loose ends, and for setting the stage for future adventures. The characters may choose to stay and help rebuild, to move on in search of new mysteries, or to confront the lingering effects of the fog—strange powers, haunted dreams, or the whispers of the Voice that echo in the quiet moments before dawn.

**Possible endings:**

- The fog lifts, and Mistvale begins to heal. Flowers bloom where once only weeds grew, and the villagers slowly reclaim their lives.
- The fog remains, but the cult is gone—at least for now. The village is wary, but hope flickers in the darkness.
- The Voice is banished, but at the cost of a character's life or soul. A memorial is built, and stories are told of the heroes who faced the darkness.
- The curse is broken, but a new threat emerges from the darkness. Strange omens appear, and rumors of trouble in neighboring lands begin to spread.

**Epilogue Narration**

*The fog begins to lift, revealing the first rays of sun over Mistvale. Villagers emerge from their homes, stunned, and look at you with both respect and fear. The crow takes flight, vanishing into the horizon. You know you have changed the village's fate, but also that darkness always lurks in the world's forgotten corners. As you leave, a last glance back reveals that the fog never truly disappears.*

The party’s legacy is uncertain, but their deeds will be remembered—whether as saviors, martyrs, or harbingers of further change. The world beyond Mistvale awaits, full of new challenges and old shadows.

###### Suspicious Behaviors in Villagers

Villagers in Mistvale often act in ways that betray their fear or complicity. Observant characters may notice:

- **Avoiding eye contact when asked about the abbey:** Villagers quickly change the subject or walk away.
- **Whispering and glancing at the party when they pass:** Groups of villagers hush as the party approaches.
- **Locking doors and windows at sunset:** The village becomes eerily quiet as night falls.
- **Leaving offerings at the edge of the woods:** Small bundles of herbs, bread, or coins are left as appeasement.
- **Refusing to speak the name of the cult leader:** Even when pressed, villagers only refer to "the one in the mist."

###### Ways to Earn the Villagers' Trust

Winning the trust of Mistvale’s people can open doors and reveal secrets. The party can:

1. **Help find a missing child or pet:** Acts of kindness are remembered and rewarded.
2. **Heal a sick villager or livestock:** Practical aid earns gratitude.
3. **Stand up to a bully or cultist in public:** Bravery inspires others to speak out.
4. **Share food or resources with the needy:** Generosity is rare and valued.
5. **Show respect for local traditions and taboos:** Observing rituals and avoiding forbidden places builds rapport.
